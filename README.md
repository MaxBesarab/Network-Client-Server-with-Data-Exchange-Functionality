# Network-Client-Server-with-Data-Exchange-Functionality

The "Network Client-Server with Data Exchange Functionality" project was developed as part of an educational programming course at the university. The primary objective of the project was to learn and apply technical aspects of network programming and graphical user interface (GUI) development using the Qt framework.

## Features

- **Client-Server Architecture:** The project is designed as a system with both server and client components. The server handles incoming client connections and manages the exchange of data.
- **Network Interaction:** Utilizing sockets for communication, the project establishes a connection between the server and clients. This facilitates the secure exchange of textual information among different devices across a network.
- **Multithreaded Processing:** To ensure efficient handling of multiple clients simultaneously, the project employs multithreading. This enables parallel processing of requests and optimal utilization of system resources.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** The client application is implemented using the Qt framework, showcasing the ability to develop modern and user-friendly graphical interfaces.

## Technologies

- Programming Language: C++
- Libraries: Winsock for network communication, Qt for graphical user interface

## Server Commands

The server graphical interface offers the following commands to interact with connected clients:

- **"buffer":** Display the contents of the client's clipboard buffer.
- **"getEnteredKeys":** Display recorded keyboard key presses captured from the client.
- **"Keylogger ON/OFF":** Toggle the keylogger functionality on or off for capturing keyboard input from the client.
- **"Clipboard account number auto replacement ON/OFF":** Toggle the automatic replacement of the client's copied account number in the clipboard.

## Running the Project

1. **Compile the Client:** Compile the client application (client.cpp) into an executable (e.g., client.exe) using a C++ compiler. This can typically be done using a command-line compiler or an integrated development environment (IDE).
2. **Server Setup:** Run the server application on a machine of your choice.
3. **Client Launch:** Execute the compiled client executable (client.exe) on the client machines that you want to participate in the data exchange.
4. **Data Exchange:** Use the graphical interface of the server application to initiate data exchange and collaborate with other clients connected to the server.

## Conclusion

The "Network Client-Server with Data Exchange Functionality" project is an educational endeavor aimed at mastering network programming concepts, multithreading, and GUI development using the Qt framework. It has been designed with a focus on educational and does not include any malicious functionality.

## Note

This project is intended for educational purposes only and does not support the creation of malicious software.
